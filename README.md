# Back-End HealthLens Application

This repository deploys the back-end functionality of our HealthLens application. It is through the deployment of this back-end service that our HealthLens application allows for persistent user-data, login/authentication functionality, and enables correct routing for all of our additional features (such as our custom email report functionality, our doctor-finder tool, or our WatsonAssistant-powered chatbot). This document will be organized by having a general [structure](#structure) layout of the repo and an explanation as to the [context of the larger project](#context-of-larger-project).
